# Solum-Nox
A theme for [The Archive](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/), a brilliant piece of software by [Christian Tietze](http://christiantietze.de).

It's based heavily and shamelessly on Atom's One Dark theme.

## Resources
This repo includes a basic script that just copies the theme into your theme folder.
